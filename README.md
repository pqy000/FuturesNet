Each of these files plays a crucial role in the pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and results visualization.

## 🚀 Model Architecture

FuturesNet is designed to handle complex and high-frequency financial data. Its hybrid architecture consists of:

- **Inception Modules** to capture multiscale features of price changes.
- **LSTM Layers** for modeling long-term dependencies.
- **Autoregressive Components** to enhance predictive accuracy and smooth out sudden market fluctuations.

The combined architecture ensures that **FuturesNet** excels in capturing both rapid and gradual changes in the market, offering a holistic solution for futures trading prediction tasks. 🏆

## 🔧 Requirements

Ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (depending on the backend of your choice)
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

You can install all the dependencies via the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of **domestic futures trading data**. Please refer to our paper for detailed descriptions of the features and data structures. You can also use custom datasets, but ensure that they follow a similar format for seamless integration with the **FuturesNet** preprocessing pipeline.

For more information on how to format your custom dataset, check out our example in `process_data.py`.
