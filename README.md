Each of these files plays a crucial role in the pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and results visualization.

## 🚀 Model Architecture

FuturesNet is designed to handle complex and high-frequency financial data. Its hybrid architecture consists of:

- **Inception Modules** to capture multiscale features of price changes.
- **LSTM Layers** for modeling long-term dependencies.
- **Autoregressive Components** to enhance predictive accuracy and smooth out sudden market fluctuations.

The combined architecture ensures that **FuturesNet** excels in capturing both rapid and gradual changes in the market, offering a holistic solution for futures trading prediction tasks. 🏆

## 🔧 Requirements

Ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (depending on the backend of your choice)
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

You can install all the dependencies via the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Training the Model

To train **FuturesNet** on your dataset, simply run the following command. Make sure that your data is preprocessed and stored in the appropriate directory.

```bash
python train.py --data_dir ./newdata --save_dir ./save
```

By default, the model checkpoints and logs will be stored in the specified `--save_dir`.

### 2️⃣ Running Predictions

Once the model is trained, you can run predictions on preprocessed data with:

```bash
python main.py --data_dir ./newdata --model_dir ./models/futuresnet_model
```

This command will output predictions to the directory specified.

### 3️⃣ Data Preprocessing

If your data is raw, you’ll first need to preprocess it. This can be done using:

```bash
python process_data.py --input_dir ./rawdata --output_dir ./newdata
```

Ensure that your data matches the input structure outlined in the paper for optimal results.

### 4️⃣ Visualizing the Results 📊

After training and evaluation, visualize the performance of **FuturesNet** with rich plots and metrics using the following script:

```bash
python visualize/plot_results.py --results_dir ./output
```

This will generate insightful plots of the predictions versus actual values, helping you to better interpret the model's accuracy.

## 📊 Sample Results

Here's an example of what you might expect when you visualize **FuturesNet** results:
